				<H1> Hi I'm Louis, Welcome to my profile üëã</H1>

				<p id="intro">I'm a student at Essec Business school. I've been into cars my whole life and recently got into watches. I also enjoy music and photography.</p>

				<h2>Cars <i class="fas fa-car" style="font-size: 24px"> </i></h2>
				<p>
				As a child I wasn't ever into football like all the others, my obsession has always been cars. I like taking photos of cars, driving them, and even cleaning them. I actually plan on oppening my own car cleaning shop in my hometown. By the way all the shades of grey used on this website are Porsche paint colors.

				<h2>Watches <i class="fa fa-clock-o" style="font-size:24px"></i> </h2>
				<p>
				I have been into watches for two to three years. Before that, I only saw watches as tools, nothing more. But after purchasing a watch with a automatic movement i.e. a watch powered only with the movement of your wrist through a complexe mechanism, I realised that watches, like cars, can sometimes be considered as pieces of art and involve true craftslanship as well as innovative engineering. I would say that I now love horology as much as cars.

				<h2>Music <i class="fa fa-music" aria-hidden="true" style="font-size: 24px"></i> </h2>
				<p>
				Music has always been important to me. I like almost all types of music, my favorites styles are Jazz, Rock and HIP-HOP. Also, I have been playing the piano for about ten years. I used to take lessons but stopped because I hated it. I now practice on my own using youtube videos, which I enjoy way more.
